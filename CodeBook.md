## Activity Label

* `WALKING`            : subject was walking 
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`   : subject was walking up a staircase 
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` : subject was walking down a staircase 
* `SITTING`            : subject was sitting 
* `STANDING`           : subject was standing 
* `LAYING`             : subject was laying down 


## Features

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* `tBodyAcc-XYZ`
* `tGravityAcc-XYZ`
* `tBodyAccJerk-XYZ`
* `tBodyGyro-XYZ`
* `tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ`
* `tBodyAccMag`
* `tGravityAccMag`
* `tBodyAccJerkMag`
* `tBodyGyroMag`
* `tBodyGyroJerkMag`
* `fBodyAcc-XYZ`
* `fBodyAccJerk-XYZ`
* `fBodyGyro-XYZ`
* `fBodyAccMag`
* `fBodyAccJerkMag`
* `fBodyGyroMag`
* `fBodyGyroJerkMag`

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
* `gravityMean`
* `tBodyAccMean`
* `tBodyAccJerkMean`
* `tBodyGyroMean`
* `tBodyGyroJerkMean`
